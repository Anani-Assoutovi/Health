    "1.\t**Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**\n",
    "  * **Compute mean**, median, variance of each vaccine’s coverage rate.\n",
    "  * **Plot histograms** or box-plots to compare distribution shapes (e.g. is Varicella uptake more spread out than MMR?).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Group Comparisons**\n",
    "  * By School Type (Public vs Private): test for significant differences in coverage with t-tests or non-parametric tests.\n",
    "  * By County: rank counties by average coverage for each vaccine, identify top-/bottom-performers.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "3.\t**Temporal Trends**\n",
    "  * Track how coverage rates change from 2019–2024 for each vaccine (line plots).\n",
    "  * Compute year-over-year deltas and highlight vaccines with improving or declining uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\t**Correlation & Multivariate Relationships**\n",
    "  * Correlate coverage rates across vaccines (e.g. do schools with high Tdap also have high MMR?).\n",
    "  * If you re-merge in the exemption rates, explore negative correlations between exemptions and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\t**Clustering & Segmentation**\n",
    "  * **Cluster ISDs** or counties by their multi-vaccine profile using k-means or hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "  * **Visualize clusters** on a map or in a PCA plot to find patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\t**Geospatial Mapping**\n",
    "  * Use a **choropleth of Texas counties** to show geographic variations in vaccine uptake.\n",
    "  * Overlay school-type or exemption cluster boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\t**Anomaly/Outlier Detection**\n",
    "  * Identify schools or years where coverage suddenly drops or spikes, flagging data-quality issues or local events.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\t**Predictive Modeling & Forecasting**\n",
    "  * Fit time series models (ARIMA, Prophet) per vaccine to forecast next year’s coverage.\n",
    "  * Build regression models to predict coverage rates from demographic or exemption covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\t**Threshold & Compliance Monitoring**\n",
    "  * **Tabulate** how many ISDs fall below critical public-health thresholds (e.g. MMR < 95%).\n",

    "We extract distinct categories from the `school_type` column (e.g., Public School, Private School, Public ISD).  \n",
    "These categories serve as our comparison groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compute Group Means\n",
    "For each vaccine (Tdap/Td, Meningococcal, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, MMR, Polio, Varicella), we calculate the **average coverage rate** in each school type.  \n",
    "This reveals which school types tend to have higher or lower uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Way ANOVA\n",
    "- **Objective:** Test if the mean coverage differs across school types.  \n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** All group means are equal.  \n",
    "- **F-Statistic:** Ratio of between-group to within-group variance.  \n",
    "- **p-Value:** Probability of observing the F-statistic under H₀.  \n",
    "  - A small p (e.g., < 0.05) indicates significant differences in means.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kruskal–Wallis Test\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Nonparametric alternative to ANOVA for non‑Normal or heteroscedastic data.  \n",
    "- **H-Statistic:** Based on ranked data across groups.  \n",
    "- **p-Value:** Tests if at least one group’s median differs.  \n",
    "  - A small p-value indicates a significant difference in distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization\n",
    "We use **box plots** to display each vaccine’s coverage distribution by school type:  \n",
    "- **Median** and **interquartile range** show central tendency and spread.  \n",
    "- **Outliers** highlight exceptional values.  \n",
    "This visual comparison complements statistical test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting Our Results\n",
    "- **Group Means:** Indicate which school types have higher or lower average coverage.  \n",
    "- **Significant ANOVA p-value:** Implies at least one pair of school types differs in mean coverage.  \n",
    "  - Follow-up with post‑hoc tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) to pinpoint specific differences.  \n",
    "- **Significant Kruskal p-value:** Confirms distributional differences without assuming Normality.  \n",
    "- **Box Plots:** Allow quick assessment of overlap and variation among school types."

    "\n",
    "**Reading the Matrix**  \n",
    "  * Diagonal elements are always 1 (each vaccine perfectly correlates with itself).\n",
    "  * Off-diagonal elements tell you how two different vaccines move together:\n",
    "    * **r > 0.8**: very strong positive relationship—schools that are good at one vaccine tend to be good at the other.\n",
    "    * **r ≈ 0.5–0.8**: moderate positive relationship.\n",
    "    * **r ≈ 0.2–0.5**: weak positive.\n",
    "    * **r ≈ 0**: little to no linear association.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizing with a Heatmap**  \n",
    "  * **The interactive heatmap** colors cells red for strong positive, blue for strong negative (rare here), and white near zero.\n",
    "  * Hover over any cell to see the exact r value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Insights**  \n",
    "  * If **Tdap/Td** and **MMR** show **r ≈ 0.95**, it suggests that districts achieving high compliance with Tdap almost always achieve high MMR coverage too.\n",
    "  * A slightly lower correlation (say **r ≈ 0.75**) between Hepatitis A and Varicella might indicate that uptake strategies or exemptions differ for those vaccines.\n",
    "  * Any unexpectedly low correlation (e.g. **r < 0.5**) flags a pair worth deeper investigation—perhaps logistical issues or policy differences affect one vaccine but not another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters**  \n",
    "  * **Program alignment**: Strong correlations suggest efficient, bundled delivery of multiple vaccines.\n",
    "  * **Targeted interventions**: Weaker correlations identify vaccines that lag behind peers, guiding where to focus outreach or policy changes.\n",
    "  * **Policy evaluation**: Tracking these correlations over time can show whether integrated vaccination efforts are becoming more or less cohesive."

    "**Feature Construction**  \n",
    "    We start with each county’s mean coverage rate for each of the seven vaccines (Tdap/Td, Meningococcal, Hep A, Hep B, MMR, Polio, Varicella). This turns each county into a seven-dimensional “profile” of vaccine uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardization**  \n",
    "    Because coverage rates for different vaccines can have different scales or variances, we **z-score** each dimension (subtract its mean and divide by its standard deviation). This ensures that no single vaccine dominates the clustering just by having a wider spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Means Clustering**  \n",
    "    We choose **K=4** (but you could experiment with other values) and let **K-Means** partition the counties into four groups based on their standardized multi-vaccine profiles.  \n",
    "    * Cluster assignment: each county is labeled **0–3** according to which of the four centroids it’s nearest to in **7-D** space.\n",
    "    * Cluster sizes: we print how many counties fell into each group so you can see if clusters are roughly balanced or skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCA 2D Visualization**  \n",
    "    To make these **high-dimensional** clusters visible, we run a Principal Components Analysis **(PCA)** and project each county onto the first two principal components (the two directions that capture the most variation).  \n",
    "    * We then plot each county as a point in this **2D PCA** plane, colored by cluster label.\n",
    "    * County names appear on hover, so you can identify examples from each group.\n",
    "    * Well-separated clouds of points indicate that the clustering found genuinely distinct vaccine-uptake patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Centers Profile**  \n",
    "    Finally, we un-standardize each cluster’s centroid back into the original coverage-rate scale and plot a grouped bar chart showing the average coverage for each vaccine in each cluster. This lets you read off, for example:  \n",
    "    * **Cluster 0** might have uniformly high **(> 95%)** coverage across all vaccines—“top performers.”\n",
    "    * **Cluster 1** might score high on MMR and Polio but lag on Varicella—suggesting targeted outreach needs.\n",
    "    * **Cluster 2** might be low across the board—counties requiring broad program support.\n",
    "    * **Cluster 3** might present a mixed profile (e.g. strong Hep B but weak Tdap).\n",
